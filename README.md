# Predicting MPG using Vehicle Characteristics

This file contains code in which we analyzed various vehicle characteristics and used our analysis to determine the best model with which to predict miles per gallon. We ran diagnostics on each predictor and transformed our data to ensure it met all the necessary assumptions. Next, we used stepwise-selection and best-subset selection techniques to choose the ideal model for the data. Lastly, we checked the predictors for multicollinearity before finalizing our model.
